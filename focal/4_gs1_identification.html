      <h3>Chain of GS1 Credentials to Identify a Trade Item</h3>
      <h4>Background</h4>
      <p>
            This use case has been provided by <a href="https://www.gs1.org/" rel="nofollow">GS1</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
            GS1 is the global supply chain standards development organization behind the retail barcode. The content of
            the barcode, the Global Trade Item Number (GTIN), is a 13-digit string composed of a GS1 Company Prefix (a
            unique string of 4-12 digits), a trade item reference (a numeric string unique within the GS1 Company Prefix to bring
            the length up to 12 digits), and a check digit (a mathematical calculation to detect keying errors).
      </p>
      <p>
            The GS1 Company Prefix is licensed to a user company by a local GS1 Member Organization. The license gives
            the user company the right to issue GS1 identification keys within the range of the GS1 Company Prefix and
            to issue Verifiable Credentials referring to the license Verifiable Credential.
      </p>
      <p>
            The license Verifiable Credential may be revoked if the user company fails to abide by the terms and
            conditions or may be transferred to another user company as part of a merger and acquisition.
      </p>
      <p>
            If the license is revoked, no new Verifiable Credentials derived from it may be issued. If the license is
            transferred, existing derived Verifiable Credentials remain valid, and the new user company may issue new
            Verifiable Credentials, including some that refer to Verifiable Credentials issued by the previous user
            company.
      </p>
      <div class="note">
            <p>
                  The core GS1 standard is the identification of objects in the supply chain, typically trade items, but also
                  locations, shipping containers, and much more. Every object is identified using a GS1 identification key,
                  sometimes alongside a secondary key for higher granularity (e.g., a serial number alongside a GTIN to
                  identify a specific instance of a trade item). Much of the text in this use case refers to keys and key
                  credentials. These are the GS1 identification keys, <strong>not</strong> cryptographic keys.
            </p>
      </div>
      <h4>Distinction</h4>
      <p>
            This differs from other focal use cases in that the rights granted by a Verifiable Credential can be
            transferred
            to another subject, without invalidating other Verifiable Credentials created by the original subject.
      </p>
      <h4>Scenario</h4>
      <p>
            Healthy Tots, a baby food manufacturer, wishes to list its products on the Sell Anything &amp; Everything
            (SA&amp;E) marketplace. As a global marketplace, SA&amp;E requires unique identification for products listed
            on its site, and has chosen the GTIN as the preferred identification key. To ensure uniqueness, SA&amp;E
            requires that companies listing products prove that they have the right to issue the GTINs they are using.
      </p>

      <h4>Validation Requirements</h4>
      <p>
            A GS1 Prefix license Verifiable Credential is valid if it is issued by GS1 Global Office.
      </p>
      <p>
            A GS1 Company Prefix license Verifiable Credential is valid if:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>
                  the issuer is the same as the subject of the "extendsCredential";
            </li>
            <li>
                  the GS1 Company Prefix in "licenseValue" ("9521234" in the examples) starts with the same digits as
                  the GS1
                  Prefix in "licenseValue" of the "extendsCredential" ("952" in the examples); and
            </li>
            <li>
                  the credential was issued after the "extendsCredential" was issued and, if applicable, before the
                  "extendsCredential" was revoked or transferred.
            </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
            A key (GTIN) Verifiable Credential is valid if:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>
                  the issuer is the same as the subject of the "extendsCredential";
            </li>
            <li>
                  the key (GTIN) in "credentialSubject.id" ("09521234555551" in the examples) is properly based on the
                  GS1 Company Prefix in "licenseValue" of the "extendsCredential";
            </li>
            <li>
                  the credential was issued after the "extendsCredential" was issued and, if applicable, before the
                  "extendsCredential" was revoked or transferred; and
            </li>
            <li>
                  the GS1 Company Prefix license Verifiable Credential is valid.
            </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Verifiable Presentation</h4>
      <p>
            Healthy Tots presents the credential for the key (GTIN) that it has issued to identify its product as well as the GS1 Company
            Prefix license credential to prove that it has the right to issue the key to SA&amp;E. To complete the
            validation, SA&amp;E requires the GS1 Prefix license credential issued to GS1 Utopia, which is publicly
            accessible and discoverable via the GS1 Company Prefix license credential.
      </p>
      <h4>Trust Hierarchy</h4>
      <ul>
            <li>
                  GS1 Global Office is responsible for management of the GS1 identification system as a whole. It is
                  liable for ensuring that the GS1 Prefix licenses that it issues are unique.
            </li>
            <li>
                  GS1 Utopia is responsible for management of the GS1 identification system within the range(s) of the
                  GS1 Prefix(es) issued to it. It is liable for ensuring that the GS1 Company Prefix licenses that it
                  issues are unique.
            </li>
            <li>
                  Healthy Tots is responsible for management of the GS1 identification system within the range(s) of the
                  GS1 Company Prefix(es) issued to it. It is liable for ensuring that the GS1 identification keys that
                  it issues are unique.
            </li>
            <li>
                  SA&amp;E is responsible for ensuring that no two products listed on its website carry the same GTIN.
            </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Variation - License Transfer</h4>
      <p>
            GS1 license Verifiable Credentials are issued with a <code>validFrom</code> property but not a
            <code>validUntil</code>
            property. Licenses are renewable as long as the licensee abides by the terms and conditions of the GS1 Member
            Organization that issued the license, including regular license payment if required. Accordingly, the only way for
            a
            trading partner to know that a license is no longer valid is to check its status for revocation.
      </p>
      <h5>Revocation</h5>
      <p>
            Once a license credential is revoked, any extension credentials (those that extend the revoked credential or that
            extend other extension credentials) created after the revocation are invalid. For example, a GTIN key credential
            created after the revocation of the underlying GS1 Company Prefix license credential is invalid because the
            company no longer has the right to issue GTINs, or any other key, within the scope of the GS1 Company Prefix.
            Other dependent credentials that are created after revocation may be valid, such as a product recall notice linked
            to a GTIN key credential created before the revocation.
      </p>
      <p>
            Extension credentials created prior to the revocation of an extended credential may be considered valid for
            certain use cases. The key credential used to identify a trade item with a GTIN, for example, will remain valid in
            perpetuity, long after trade items identified by the GTIN are no longer in the supply chain. Some of the data
            credentials associated with the GTIN, such as those that describe the product or that provide information such as
            recycling instructions, may also be valid well beyond the revocation of the GS1 Company Prefix license credential.
      </p>
      <h5>Suspension</h5>
      <p>
            Suspension of a license is an intermediate step for some GS1 Member Organizations, to give the licensee the
            opportunity to come back into compliance with the terms and conditions of their agreement. In general, a suspended
            credential should be treated as revoked, with the caveat that the suspension status could be removed entirely or
            replaced with the revocation status. Verifiers should therefore check the credential status periodically until one
            or the other occurs.
      </p>
      <h5>Replacement</h5>
      <p>
            Replacement is similar to revocation in that it invalidates the credential, but it indicates that there is
            another, equivalent credential available. The most common use case for this is in acquisitions and mergers, as
            defined in the GS1 General Specifications:
      </p>
      <p>
            <em>
                  During an acquisition or merger, a company may assume responsibility for the acquired company's GS1 Company
                  Prefix and/or individual GS1 identification key licences. In the situations where the licences transfer, the
                  acquiring company can:
            </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>
                  <em>
                        Use the acquired company's GS1 Company Prefix(es) and GS1 identification key(s
                  </em>
            </li>
            <li>
                  <em>
                        Issue GS1 identification keys using the newly acquired GS1 Company Prefix(es)
                  </em>
            </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
            <em>
                  For example, products that the acquired company identified using its GS1 Company Prefix or individual GS1
                  identification key licences can still be produced using the same GTINs after the merger. Additionally,
                  parties, locations, assets, and other objects identified with GS1 identification keys can continue to use
                  those keys after the merger.
            </em>
      </p>
      <p>
            <em>
                  If a partial purchase occurs, where only a segment of a larger entity is acquired, the involved companies must
                  determine whether GS1 identification licences are transferred based on their specific business
                  requirements.
            </em>
      </p>
      <p>
            In such a situation, the acquiring company takes over the licenses of the acquired company and should be issued
            the appropriate credentials. Those originally issued to the acquired company are no longer valid, but simple
            revocation could be highly disruptive as there may be thousands of extension credentials that could be invalidated
            by the business rules that apply to revocation. Instead, the replacement status indicates that the licence
            credential has been replaced. As with revocation, any new extension credentials that directly reference the
            replaced credential are invalid, but pre-existing extension credentials should be validated against the
            replacement credential using the normal business rules.
      </p>
      <p>
            Suppose that Healthy Tots is acquired by Benevolent Conglomerate. Benevolent Conglomerate may decide on a
            hands-off approach and leave Healthy Tots to continue its operations much as before, with no impact on the way
            that the GS1 identification keys are managed. It's possible, though, that Benevolent Conglomerate will decide to
            discontinue Healthy Tots as a separate entity and instead absorb its products into a central catalogue. The GS1
            Company Prefix license, originally issued to Healthy Tots, will be transferred by GS1 Utopia to Benevolent
            Conglomerate.
      </p>
      <p>
            In this case, a status check of the original GS1 Company Prefix license Verifiable Credential must indicate a
            status of "replaced" and, potentially, include the ID of the replacement. Regardless of whether the status
            indicates the ID of the replacement credential, the replacement must reference the credential it replaced. The
            maintain continuity of supply chain management, the following must be supported:
      </p>
      <ul>
            <li>
                  The original key credentials issued by Healthy Tots remain valid, as:
                  <ul>
                        <li>
                              they were issued prior to the replacement;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                              the replacement references the original license credential;
                        </li>
                        <li>
                              using a combination of the original and replacement credentials, the key credentials can be validated according to
                              the business rules; and
                        </li>
                        <li>
                              the replacement GS1 Company Prefix license Verifiable Credential has not been revoked.
                        </li>
                  </ul>
            <li>
                  Benevolent Conglomerate can issue new key Verifiable Credentials based on the GS1 Company Prefix license Verifiable
                  Credential.
            </li>
            <li>
                  Benevolent Conglomerate can issue additional Verifiable Credentials based on the key Verifiable Credentials issued
                  by Healthy Tots, as the transfer (replacement) of the GS1 Company Prefix license Verifiable Credential provides an
                  authenticated chain of responsibility.
            </li>
